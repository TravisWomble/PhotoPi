# PhotoPi

This is a simple [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview) and node app to create a digital photo frame
using a Raspberry Pi. 

You just need to start your node server, then point firefox on the pi to `localhost:3000`
with [kiosk mode enabled](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mkiosk/).

Inspired by [this blog post](https://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-raspberry-pi/#piframe).
